2. In Blender, from the topbar go to Edit > Preferences
3. In the pop-up window, select "Add-ons" from the left menu.  In the top right corner, click "Install" and select the file you just downloaded.

## Functional Description
### Voxon Rendering Panel
The Voxon Rendering Panel can be found in Render Properties in Blender and contains most of the add-on's functionality.
### Viewbox
The viewbox is essentially a 3D camera for the volumetric display.  Only objects within the viewbox will be rendered.  The viewbox can be moved, rotated, scaled, and even animated.

The viewbox can be created in two ways.  If "Auto-detect Viewbox" is selected when real-time rendering, the add-on will automatically create the correctly sized viewbox upon connecting to the Voxon Device.
